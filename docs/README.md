# SteamShip Documentation

SteamShip helps you set up games to work with Steam using Lua scripts, manifests, and LumaCore. It writes the right files into your Steam folder so games can run. It does not replace or crack Steam itself.

**What you need before using SteamShip**

- Steam installed.  
- LumaCore — SteamShip copies `dwmapi.dll` + `LumaCore.dll` into your Steam folder via **Auto LC Setup** (Home tab). See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for details.  
- A Lua file for the game (or use SteamShip to download one).  

**Quick start**

1. Read the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) to install what you need (including LumaCore).  
2. Read the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md) to see how each menu option works.  
3. Use the [Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for commands and shortcuts.
